# Unit and regression tests for SMK

All tests are written to by run by [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). Note that not
all tests in this directory are expected to pass, but the specific tests set up for continuous
integration in `.github/workflows/main.yml` should all work.

For info on setting up a working conda environment to run these tests, and other general guidance,
see [the SMK contributing guide](
https://ismk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/contributing.html#testing-guidelines).
